# go-service-template

This is a template for a Go service. It includes a basic structure for a Go service, with a Makefile for building and running the service, and a Dockerfile for building a Docker image.

## Getting started

- [] Create a new repository from this template
- [] Change the module name in `go.mod` using the command `go mod edit -module github.com/your-username/your-repo`
- [] Change the service name in `cmd/go-service-template` to the name of your service, e.g. `cmd/your-service-name`
- [] Change the service name in `Makefile` to the name of your service
